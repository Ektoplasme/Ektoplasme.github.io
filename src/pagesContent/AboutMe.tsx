      <h3>Facts about me:</h3>
      <p>
        - I got my first personal computer at the age of 13. Before that, I used
        the family computer to experiment with all sorts of things —probably
        filling it with viruses in the process... Sorry, Mum! 👩🏻‍💻🐛
      </p>
      <p>
        - II enjoy <b>spending time alone</b>, whether it's walking, biking, or
        relaxing in coffee shops and restaurants. I believe it's important to
        value our own company. Don’t worry, I do see people too! 👻
      </p>
      <p>
        - My cat's name is Bandicoot, inspired by the video game series I've
        always loved (my favorite is Twinsanity, even if it's a bit underrated).
      </p>
      <p>
        - I’m a fan of <b>retro gaming</b> and indie video games. I don’t have
        as much time to play these days, but when I find a game I love, I can
        immerse myself in it for days!
      </p>
      <p>
        - I'm a recovering social media addict. I switched to a minimalist,
        Blackberry-style smartphone with no social media apps (except WhatsApp
        for family). I still access social media through my laptop. Fun fact: my
        phone has GBA and NDS emulators! 💁‍♀️
      </p>
      <p>
        - I come from a <b>big family</b> —I have seven sisters, and I’m the
        fourth. We’re a close-knit bunch, and two of them are also into coding!
      </p>
      <p>
        - I care about my <b>health and well-being</b>. I’ve learned to eat
        well, and I try to stay active by biking, walking, running, or hitting
        the gym, also i’ve been journaling since I was a child. 📖
      </p>
      <p>
        - I read a lot, but i <b>often forget what i've read</b>. I'm starting a
        journal to summerize the books i've read so i don't forget anymore 👵🏻
