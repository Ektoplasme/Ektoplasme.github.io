      <h3>Facts about me:</h3>
      <h4>
        - I got my first personal computer at the age of 13. Before that, I used
        the family computer to experiment with all sorts of things —probably
        filling it with viruses in the process... Sorry, Mum! 👩🏻‍💻🐛
      </h4>
      <h4>
        - II enjoy spending time alone, whether it's walking, biking, or
        relaxing in coffee shops and restaurants. I believe it's important to
        value our own company. Don’t worry, I do see people too! 👻
      </h4>
      <h4>
        - My cat's name is Bandicoot, inspired by the video game series I've
        always loved (my favorite is Twinsanity, even if it's a bit underrated).
      </h4>
      <h4>
        - I’m a fan of retro gaming and indie video games. I don’t have as much
        time to play these days, but when I find a game I love, I can immerse
        myself in it for days!
      </h4>
      <h4>
        - I'm a recovering social media addict. After researching their
        downsides, I switched to a minimalist, Blackberry-style smartphone with
        no social media apps (except WhatsApp for family). I still access social
        media through my laptop when needed. Fun fact: my phone has GBA and NDS
        emulators! 💁‍♀️
      </h4>
      <h4>
        - I come from a big family —I have seven sisters, and I’m the fourth.
        We’re a close-knit bunch, and two of them are also into coding!
      </h4>
      <h4>
        - I care about my health and well-being. I’ve learned to eat well, and I
        try to stay active by biking, walking, running, or hitting the gym, also
        i’ve been journaling since I was a child. 📖
      </h4>
      <h4>
        - I read a lot, but i often forget what i've read. I'm starting a
        journal to summerize the books i've read so i don't forget anymore 👵🏻
